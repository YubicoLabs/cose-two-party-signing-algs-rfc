                   Split signing algorithms for COSE
           draft-lundberg-cose-two-party-signing-algs-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers for negotiating
   how to split a signature algorithm between two cooperating parties.
   Typically the first party hashes the data to be signed and the second
   party finishes the signature over the hashed data.  This is a common
   technique, useful for example when the signing private key is held in
   a smart card or similar hardware component with limited processing
   power and communication bandwidth.  The resulting signatures are
   identical in structure to those computed by a single party, and can
   be verified using the same verification algorithm without additional
   steps to preprocess the signed data.

1.  Introduction

   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC9052] algorithm
   identifiers are used for algorithm negotiation and to annotate
   cryptographic objects with how to interpret them, for example which
   algorithm to use to verify a signature or decapsulate a shared key.
   Existing COSE algorithm identifiers omit some internal details of how
   the object was constructed, since those details are typically
   irrelevant for the recipient.

   The algorithm identifiers defined in this specification are meant for
   a complementary use case: to divide responsibilities during
   _construction_ of a cryptographic object, instead of describing how
   to _consume_ the object.  Specifically, they provide an interoperable
   way to negotiate how a signing operation is split between two
   cooperating parties, for example, a smart card and a software
   application, while the verification algorithm for the resulting
   signature remains the same as if the signature was created by a
   single party.  These split algorithm identifiers are therefore not
   meant for annotating signature objects, since the verification
   algorithm is better indicated using already existing algorithm
   identifiers.

   As mentioned above, a primary use case for this is for algorithm
   negotiation between a software application and a smart card or other
   hardware security module (HSM) holding the signing private key.
   Since the HSM may have limited processing power and communication
   bandwidth, it may not be practical to send the entire original
   message to the HSM.  Instead, since most signature algorithms begin
   with digesting the message into a fixed-length intermediate input,
   this initial digest can be computed by the software application while
   the HSM performs the rest of the signature algorithm on the digest.
   This is a common technique used in standards such as OpenPGP
   [OPENPGPCARD], PKCS #11 [PKCS11-Spec-v3.1], and PIV [FIPS-201].

   Since different signature algorithms digest the message in different
   ways and at different stages of the algorithm, it is not possible for
   a cryptographic API to specify that, for example, "the hash digest is
   computed by the caller" generically for all algorithms.  Instead, the
   algorithm identifiers defined in this specification enable the
   parties of that cryptographic API to signal precisely, for each
   signature algorithm individually, which steps of the algorithm are
   performed by which party.  We thus define two roles: the _digester_
   (e.g., a software application) that initializes the signing
   procedure, and the _signer_ (e.g., an HSM) that holds exclusive
   control of the signing private key.

   Note that these algorithm identifiers do not define new "pre-hashed"
   variants of the base signature algorithm, nor an intermediate "hash
   envelope" data structure, such as that defined in
   [I-D.COSE-Hash-Envelope].  Rather, these identifiers denote existing
   signature algorithms that would typically be executed by a single
   party, but split into two stages.

   Some signature algorithms, such as PureEdDSA [RFC8032], by their
   design, cannot be split in this way, and therefore cannot be assigned
   split signing algorithm identifiers.  However, if such a signature
   algorithm defines a "pre-hashed" variant, such as Ed25519ph
   [RFC8032], that "pre-hashed" algorithm can be assigned a split
   signing algorithm identifier, enabling the pre-hashing step to be
   performed by the _digester_ and the remaining steps by the _signer_.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC2119 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Split Signing Algorithms

   This section defines divisions of signing algorithm steps between a
   _digester_ and a _signer_ in a split signing protocol, and assigns
   algorithm identifiers to these algorithm divisions.  The _digester_
   performs the first part of the split algorithm and does not have
   access to the signing private key, while the _signer_ performs the
   second part of the split algorithm and has access to the signing
   private key.  For signing algorithms that format the message to
   insert domain separation tags, as described in Section 2.2.5 of
   [RFC9380], this message formatting is also performed by the _signer_.

   The algorithm identifiers defined in this specification MAY appear in
   COSE structures used internally between the _digester_ and the
   _signer_ in a split signing protocol, but SHOULD NOT appear in COSE
   structures consumed by signature verifiers.  COSE structures consumed
   by signature verifiers SHOULD instead use the corresponding
   conventional algorithm identifiers for the verification algorithm.
   These are listed in the "Verification algorithm" column in the tables
   defining split signing algorithm identifiers.

2.1.  ECDSA

   ECDSA [FIPS-186-5] split signing uses the following division between
   the _digester_ and the _signer_ of the steps of the ECDSA signature
   generation algorithm [FIPS-186-5]:

   *  The signing procedure is defined in Section 6.4.1 of [FIPS-186-5].

   *  The _digester_ performs Step 1 of the signing procedure - hashing
      the message, producing the value _H_.

   *  The message input to the _signer_ is the value _H_ defined in the
      signing procedure.

   *  The _signer_ resumes the signing procedure from Step 2.

   The following algorithm identifiers are defined:

   +==============+=======+==============+============================+

   +--------------+-------+--------------+----------------------------+

                                 Table 1

   Note: This is distinct from the similarly named Split-ECDSA (SECDSA)
   [SECDSA], although SECDSA can be implemented using this split
   procedure as a component.

2.2.  HashEdDSA

   Split HashEdDSA [RFC8032] uses the following division between the
   _digester_ and the _signer_ of the steps of the HashEdDSA signing
   algorithm [RFC8032]:

   *  HashEdDSA is a combination of the EdDSA signing procedure and the
      PureEdDSA signing procedure.  The EdDSA signing procedure is
      defined in the first paragraph of Section 3.3 of [RFC8032].  The
      PureEdDSA signing procedure is defined in the second paragraph of
      Section 3.3 of [RFC8032].

   *  The _digester_ computes the value PH(M) defined in the EdDSA
      signing procedure.

   *  The message input to the _signer_ is the value PH(M) defined in
      the EdDSA signing procedure.  This value is represented as M in
      the PureEdDSA signing procedure.

   *  The _signer_ executes the PureEdDSA signing procedure, where the
      value denoted M in the PureEdDSA signing procedure takes the value
      denoted PH(M) in the EdDSA signing procedure.

   PureEdDSA [RFC8032] cannot be divided in this way since such a
   division would require that the _digester_ has access to the private
   key.

   The following algorithm identifiers are defined:

3.  COSE Signing Arguments

   While many signature algorithms take the private key and data to be
   signed as the only two parameters, some signature algorithms have
   additional parameters that must also be set.  For example, to sign
   using a key derived by ARKG [I-D.bradleylundberg-ARKG], two
   additional arguments kh and ctx are needed in ARKG-Derive-Private-Key
   to derive the signing private key.

   While such additional arguments are simple to provide to the API of
   the signing procedure in a single-party context, in a split signing
   context these additional arguments also need to be conveyed from the
   _digester_ to the _signer_. For this purpose, we define a new COSE
   structure COSE_Sign_Args for "COSE signing arguments".  This enables
   defining a unified, algorithm-agnostic protocol between the
   _digester_ and the _signer_, rather than requiring a distinct
   protocol for each signature algorithm for the sake of conveying
   algorithm-specific parameters.

   COSE_Sign_Args is built on a CBOR map.  The set of common parameters
   that can appear in a COSE_Sign_Args can be found in the IANA "COSE
   Signing Arguments Common Parameters" registry (TODO).  Additional
   parameters defined for specific signing algorithms can be found in
   the IANA "COSE Signing Arguments Algorithm Parameters" registry
   (TODO).

   The CDDL grammar describing COSE_Sign_Args, using the CDDL fragment
   defined in Section 1.5 of [RFC9052], is:

   COSE_Sign_Args = {
       3 ^ => tstr / int,  ; alg
       * label => values,
   }

3.1.  COSE Signing Arguments Common Parameters

   This document defines a set of common parameters for a COSE Signing
   Arguments object.  Table 3 provides a summary of the parameters
   defined in this section.

    +======+=======+============+=================+==================+
    | Name | Label | CBOR Type  | Value Registry  | Description      |
    +======+=======+============+=================+==================+
    | alg  | 3     | tstr / int | COSE Algorithms | Signing          |
    |      |       |            |                 | algorithm to use |
    +------+-------+------------+-----------------+------------------+

       Table 3: Common parameters of the COSE_Sign_Args structure.

   *  alg: This parameter identifies the signing algorithm the
      additional arguments apply to.  The signer MUST verify that this
      algorithm matches any key usage restrictions set on the key to be
      used.  If the algorithms do not match, then the signature
      operation MUST be aborted with an error.

   Definitions of COSE algorithms MAY define additional algorithm-
   specific parameters for COSE_Sign_Args.

   The following CDDL example conveys additional arguments for signing
   data using the ESP256-split algorithm (see Section 2.1) and a key
   derived using ARKG-P256 [I-D.bradleylundberg-ARKG]:

   {
     3: -65539,   ; alg: ESP256-split with ARKG-P256 (placeholder value)

                  ; ARKG-P256 key handle
                  ; (HMAC-SHA-256-128 followed by
                     SEC1 uncompressed ECDH public key)
     -1: h'27987995f184a44cfa548d104b0a461d

Document History

   -03

   *  Updated reference to ARKG parameter info renamed to ctx.

   *  Refined abstract and introduction to emphasize that the central
      novelty is not split algorithms as a concept, but providing COSE
      algorithm identifiers for use cases that benefit from such
      splitting.

   -02

   *  Renamed document from "COSE Algorithms for Two-Party Signing" to
      "Split signing algorithms for COSE" and updated introduction and
      terminology accordingly.

   *  Dropped definitions for HashML-DSA, as split variants of ML-DSA
      are being actively discussed in other IETF groups.

   *  Changed "Base algorithm" heading in definition tables to
      "Verification algorithm".

   *  Remodeled COSE_Key_Ref as COSE_Sign_Args.

      -  Dropped definitions of reference types for COSE Key Types
         registry.

   -01

   *  Added IANA registration requests for algorithms defined.

   *  Updated references and other editorial tweaks.

   -00

   *  Initial individual draft

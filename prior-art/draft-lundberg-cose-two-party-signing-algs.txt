                   Split signing algorithms for COSE
           draft-lundberg-cose-two-party-signing-algs-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers for negotiating
   how to split a signature algorithm between two cooperating parties.
   Typically the first party hashes the data to be signed and the second
   party finishes the signature over the hashed data.  This is a common
   technique, useful for example when the signing private key is held in
   a smart card or similar hardware component with limited processing
   power and communication bandwidth.  The resulting signatures are
   identical in structure to those computed by a single party, and can
   be verified using the same verification algorithm without additional
   steps to preprocess the signed data.

1.  Introduction

   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC9052] algorithm
   identifiers are used for algorithm negotiation and to annotate
   cryptographic objects with how to interpret them, for example which
   algorithm to use to verify a signature or decapsulate a shared key.
   Existing COSE algorithm identifiers omit some internal details of how
   the object was constructed, since those details are typically
   irrelevant for the recipient.

   The algorithm identifiers defined in this specification are meant for
   a complementary use case: to divide responsibilities during
   _construction_ of a cryptographic object, instead of describing how
   to _consume_ the object.  Specifically, they provide an interoperable
   way to negotiate how a signing operation is split between two
   cooperating parties, for example, a smart card and a software
   application, while the verification algorithm for the resulting
   signature remains the same as if the signature was created by a
   single party.  These split algorithm identifiers are therefore not
   meant for annotating signature objects, since the verification
   algorithm is better indicated using already existing algorithm
   identifiers.

   As mentioned above, a primary use case for this is for algorithm
   negotiation between a software application and a smart card or other
   hardware security module (HSM) holding the signing private key.
   Since the HSM may have limited processing power and communication
   bandwidth, it may not be practical to send the entire original
   message to the HSM.  Instead, since most signature algorithms begin
   with digesting the message into a fixed-length intermediate input,
   this initial digest can be computed by the software application while
   the HSM performs the rest of the signature algorithm on the digest.
   This is a common technique used in standards such as OpenPGP
   [OPENPGPCARD], PKCS #11 [PKCS11-Spec-v3.1], and PIV
   [NIST-SP-800-73-5].

   Since different signature algorithms digest the message in different
   ways and at different stages of the algorithm, it is not possible for
   a cryptographic API to specify that, for example, "the hash digest is
   computed by the caller" generically for all algorithms.  Security
   considerations for this split may also differ between algorithms.
   Instead, the algorithm identifiers defined in this specification
   enable the parties of that cryptographic API to signal precisely, for
   each signature algorithm individually, which steps of the algorithm
   are performed by which party.  We thus define two roles: the
   _digester_ (e.g., a software application) that initializes the
   signing procedure, and the _signer_ (e.g., an HSM) that holds
   exclusive control of the signing private key.

   Note that these algorithm identifiers do not define new "pre-hashed"
   variants of the base signature algorithm, nor an intermediate "hash
   envelope" data structure, such as that defined in
   [I-D.COSE-Hash-Envelope].  Rather, these identifiers denote existing
   signature algorithms that would typically be executed by a single
   party, but split into two stages.

   Some signature algorithms, such as PureEdDSA [RFC8032], by their
   design, cannot be split in this way, and therefore cannot be assigned
   split signing algorithm identifiers.  However, if such a signature
   algorithm defines a "pre-hashed" variant, that "pre-hashed" algorithm
   can be assigned a split signing algorithm identifier, enabling the
   pre-hashing step to be performed by the _digester_ and the remaining
   steps by the _signer_. For example, this specification defines
   Ed25519ph-split (Section 2.2) as a split variant of Ed25519ph
   [RFC8032].  Note that Ed25519 and Ed25519ph have distinct
   verification algorithms, but Ed25519ph and Ed25519ph-split use the
   same verification algorithm.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC2119 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Prior Art

   Split signing is a common technique used in existing smart card
   standards.  The following subsections expand on how the technique is
   applied in OpenPGP [OPENPGPCARD], PKCS #11 [PKCS11-Spec-v3.1], and
   PIV [NIST-SP-800-73-5].

1.2.1.  OpenPGP

   The OpenPGP smart card protocol [OPENPGPCARD] defines the format of
   signing commands in section "7.2.10 PSO: COMPUTE DIGITAL SIGNATURE":

      *7.2.10 PSO: COMPUTE DIGITAL SIGNATURE*

      The command for digital signature computation is shown in the
      table below.  The hash value (ECDSA) or the DigestInfo is
      delivered in the data field of the command. [...]

   The "Data field" parameter is subsequently defined as "Data to be
   integrated in the DSI: hash value (ELC) or DigestInfo (RSA)".  Thus
   both ECDSA and RSA signatures are computed jointly by the host
   computing the digest of the signed data and the smart card finalizing
   the signature on the digest; the host acts as _digester_ and the
   smart card acts as _signer_.

   Some OpenPGP smart card implementations also support Ed25519
   signatures; however no public specification of this protocol is
   known.

1.2.2.  PKCS #11

   PKCS #11 [PKCS11-Spec-v3.1] defines signing commands in sections
   "5.13 Signing and MACing functions" and "5.14 Message-based signing
   and MACing functions".  These sections define C_SignInit and
   C_MessageSignInit functions that both take a pMechanism parameter
   indicating the signature mechanism.  Mechanisms are defined in
   section "6 Mechanisms", which notably includes the subsections
   "6.3.12 ECDSA without hashing" and "6.3.13 ECDSA with hashing":

      *6.3.12 ECDSA without hashing*

      [...]

      The ECDSA without hashing mechanism, denoted *CKM_ECDSA*, is a
      mechanism for single-part signatures and verification for ECDSA.
      (This mechanism corresponds only to the part of ECDSA that
      processes the hash value, which should not be longer than 1024
      bits; it does not compute the hash value.)

      [...]

      *6.3.13 ECDSA with hashing*

      [...]

      The ECDSA with SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512,
      SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512 mechanism, denoted *CKM_ECD
      SA_[SHA1|SHA224|SHA256|SHA384|SHA512|SHA3_224|SHA3_256|SHA3_384|SH
      A3_512]* respectively, is a mechanism for single- and multiple-
      part signatures and verification for ECDSA.  This mechanism
      computes the entire ECDSA specification, including the hashing
      with SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA3-224,
      SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512 respectively.

      [...]

   Thus PKCS #11 supports both split signing using the *CKM_ECDSA*
   mechanism and "non-split" signing using the *CKM_ECDSA_SHA**
   mechanisms; when using *CKM_ECDSA*, the PKCS #11 caller acts as
   _host_ and the Cryptoki implementation acts as _signer_.

1.2.3.  PIV: FIPS-201, NIST SP 800

   NIST Special Publication 800 [NIST-SP-800-73-5] contains technical
   specifications for the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard
   [FIPS-201], and defines the format of signing commands in section
   "3.2.4.  GENERAL AUTHENTICATE Card Command":

      *3.2.4.  GENERAL AUTHENTICATE Card Command* [...]

      The GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command SHALL be used with the digital
      signature key ('9C') to realize the signing functionality on the
      PIV client application programming interface.  Data to be signed
      is expected to be hashed off-card.  Appendix A.4 illustrates the
      use of the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command for signature generation.

      [...]

   Appendix A.4 gives examples of RSA and ECDSA signature generation
   commands.  For RSA the command needs to be sent in two parts, giving
   the "Data Field" argument first as "'7C' – L1 { '82' '00' '81' L2
   {first part of the PKCS #1 v1.5 or PSS padded message hash value }}"
   and then "{second and last part of the PKCS #1 v1.5 or PSS padded
   message hash value}"; for ECDSA the "Data Field" argument is given as
   "'7C' – L1 { '82' '00' '81' L2 {hash value of message}}".

   Thus both ECDSA and RSA signatures are computed jointly by the host
   computing the digest of the signed data and the smart card finalizing
   the signature on the digest; the host acts as _digester_ and the
   smart card acts as _signer_.

2.  Split Signing Algorithms

   This section defines divisions of signing algorithm steps between a
   _digester_ and a _signer_ in a split signing protocol, and assigns
   algorithm identifiers to these algorithm divisions.  The _digester_
   performs the first part of the split algorithm and does not have
   access to the signing private key, while the _signer_ performs the
   second part of the split algorithm and has access to the signing
   private key.  For signing algorithms that format the message to
   insert domain separation tags, as described in Section 2.2.5 of
   [RFC9380], this message formatting is also performed by the _signer_.

   How the digest, and any related COSE_Sign_Args structure (see
   Section 3), are transported from _digester_ to _signer_ is out of
   scope for this specification, but it is expected that the digest will
   usually be transmitted as the "data to be signed" argument.

   The algorithm identifiers defined in this specification with "-split"
   in their names MAY appear in COSE structures used internally between
   the _digester_ and the _signer_ in a split signing protocol, but
   SHOULD NOT appear in COSE structures consumed by signature verifiers.
   COSE structures consumed by signature verifiers SHOULD instead use
   the corresponding conventional algorithm identifiers for the
   verification algorithm.  These are listed in the "Verification
   algorithm" column in the tables defining split signing algorithm
   identifiers.

   The following subsections define an initial set of split signing
   algorithm identifiers.  The last subsection provides guidance for
   defining additional identifiers beyond this initial set.

2.1.  ECDSA

   ECDSA [FIPS-186-5] split signing uses the following division between
   the _digester_ and the _signer_ of the steps of the ECDSA signature
   generation algorithm [FIPS-186-5]:

   *  The signing procedure is defined in Section 6.4.1 of [FIPS-186-5].

   *  The _digester_ performs Step 1 of the signing procedure - hashing
      the message, producing the value _H_.

   *  The message input to the _signer_ is the value _H_ defined in the
      signing procedure.

   *  The _signer_ resumes the signing procedure from Step 2.

   The following algorithm identifiers are defined:

     +==============+=======+==============+=========================+
     | Name         | COSE  | Verification | Description             |
     |              | Value | algorithm    |                         |
     +==============+=======+==============+=========================+
     | ESP256-split | TBD   | ESP256       | ESP256 split signing as |
     |              |       |              | defined in Section 2.1  |
     +--------------+-------+--------------+-------------------------+
     | ESP384-split | TBD   | ESP384       | ESP384 split signing as |
     |              |       |              | defined in Section 2.1  |
     +--------------+-------+--------------+-------------------------+
     | ESP512-split | TBD   | ESP512       | ESP512 split signing as |
     |              |       |              | defined in Section 2.1  |
     +--------------+-------+--------------+-------------------------+

               Table 1: ECDSA split signing algorithm values.

   Note: This is distinct from the similarly named Split-ECDSA (SECDSA)
   [SECDSA], although SECDSA can be implemented using this split
   procedure as a component.

2.2.  HashEdDSA

   Split HashEdDSA [RFC8032] uses the following division between the
   _digester_ and the _signer_ of the steps of the HashEdDSA signing
   algorithm [RFC8032]:

   *  HashEdDSA is a combination of the EdDSA signing procedure and the
      PureEdDSA signing procedure.  The EdDSA signing procedure is
      defined in the first paragraph of Section 3.3 of [RFC8032].  The
      PureEdDSA signing procedure is defined in the second paragraph of
      Section 3.3 of [RFC8032].

   *  The _digester_ computes the value PH(M) defined in the EdDSA
      signing procedure.

   *  The message input to the _signer_ is the value PH(M) defined in
      the EdDSA signing procedure.  This value is represented as M in
      the PureEdDSA signing procedure.

   *  The _signer_ executes the PureEdDSA signing procedure, where the
      value denoted M in the PureEdDSA signing procedure takes the value
      denoted PH(M) in the EdDSA signing procedure.

   PureEdDSA [RFC8032] cannot be divided in this way since such a
   division would require that the _digester_ has access to the private
   key.

   The following algorithm identifiers are defined:

    +=================+=======+==============+========================+
    | Name            | COSE  | Verification | Description            |

2.3.  Defining Split Signing Algorithms

   Future definitions of additional split signing algorithm identifiers
   SHOULD follow the conventions established in Section 2 as far as
   possible.  For example, if a signature algorithm prescribes insertion
   of domain separation tags in a way that requires processing the
   entirety of the data to be signed, it might be necessary to delegate
   the domain separation responsibility to the _digester_. Per the
   considerations in Section 4.2, split signing algorithm identifiers
   SHOULD be defined in ways that minimize how much responsibility is
   delegated to the _digester_.

   As a concrete example, consider ML-DSA and HashML-DSA [FIPS-204].
   ML-DSA and HashML-DSA prefix the input data with a 0 octet and a 1
   octet respectively, which enforces domain separation between ML-DSA
   and HashML-DSA signatures.  Appendix D of [RFC9881] describes a mode
   of ML-DSA that could be assigned a split signing algorithm identifier
   where the _digester_ performs Computeμ and the _signer_ performs
   Signμ. Note that this puts the _digester_ in control of the domain
   separation tags; this is necessary if the hash step is not performed
   by the _signer_. Therefore with this construction, it is the
   _digester_ that decides whether the signing protocol will produce an
   ML-DSA signature or a HashML-DSA signature.  In contrast, HashML-DSA
   first hashes the input data alone and then another time with domain
   separation tags; therefore HashML-DSA can be assigned a split signing
   algorithm identifier that keeps the _signer_ in control of the domain
   separation tags and ensures that the signing protocol can only
   produce HashML-DSA signatures.

3.  COSE Signing Arguments

   While many signature algorithms take the private key and data to be
   signed as the only two parameters, some signature algorithms have
   additional parameters that must also be set.  For example, to sign
   using a key derived by ARKG [I-D.bradleylundberg-ARKG], two
   additional arguments kh and ctx are needed in ARKG-Derive-Private-Key
   to derive the signing private key.

   While such additional arguments are simple to provide to the API of
   the signing procedure in a single-party context, in a split signing
   context these additional arguments also need to be conveyed from the
   _digester_ to the _signer_. For this purpose, we define a new COSE
   structure COSE_Sign_Args for "COSE signing arguments".  This enables
   defining a unified, algorithm-agnostic protocol between the
   _digester_ and the _signer_, rather than requiring a distinct
   protocol for each signature algorithm for the sake of conveying
   algorithm-specific parameters.

   COSE_Sign_Args is built on a CBOR map.  The set of common parameters
   that can appear in a COSE_Sign_Args can be found in the IANA "COSE
   Signing Arguments Common Parameters" registry (TODO).  Additional
   parameters defined for specific signing algorithms can be found in
   the IANA "COSE Signing Arguments Algorithm Parameters" registry
   (TODO).

   The CDDL grammar describing COSE_Sign_Args, using the CDDL fragment
   defined in Section 1.5 of [RFC9052], is:

   COSE_Sign_Args = {
       3 ^ => tstr / int,  ; alg
       * label => values,
   }

3.1.  COSE Signing Arguments Common Parameters

   This document defines a set of common parameters for a COSE Signing
   Arguments object.  Table 3 provides a summary of the parameters
   defined in this section.

    +======+=======+============+=================+==================+
    | Name | Label | CBOR Type  | Value Registry  | Description      |
    +======+=======+============+=================+==================+
    | alg  | 3     | tstr / int | COSE Algorithms | Signing          |
    |      |       |            |                 | algorithm to use |
    +------+-------+------------+-----------------+------------------+

       Table 3: Common parameters of the COSE_Sign_Args structure.

   *  alg: This parameter identifies the signing algorithm the
      additional arguments apply to.  The signer MUST verify that this
      algorithm matches any key usage restrictions set on the key to be
      used.  If the algorithms do not match, then the signature
      operation MUST be aborted with an error.

   Definitions of COSE algorithms MAY define additional algorithm-
   specific parameters for COSE_Sign_Args.

   The following CDDL example conveys additional arguments for signing
   data using the ESP256-split algorithm (see Section 2.1) and a key
   derived using ARKG-P256 [I-D.bradleylundberg-ARKG]:

     -2: 'ARKG-P256.test vectors',
   }

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Protocol-Level Trusted Roles

   This specification assumes that both the _digester_ and _signer_
   roles described in Section 2 are trusted and cooperate honestly.
   This is because a similar division between "application" and "secure
   element" typically exists already: even if all steps of the signing
   algorithm are executed in a trusted secure element, the inputs to the
   secure element are provided by some outside component such as a
   software application.  If the application can provide any input to be
   signed, then for all practical purposes it is trusted with possession
   of any private keys for as long as it is authorized to exercise the
   secure element.  The application can in practice obtain a signature
   over any chosen message without needing to perform a forgery attack.
   The same relationship exists between _digester_ and _signer_.
   Applications that cannot trust an external _digester_ - for example a
   hardware security device with an integrated secure display of what
   data is about to be signed - by definition have no use for split
   signing algorithm identifiers.

   Similarly from a verifier's perspective, these split signing
   procedures are implementation details.  When a signature is generated
   by a single party, that single party takes on both the _digester_ and
   the _signer_ roles, and obviously trusts itself to perform the
   _digester_ role honestly.  From the verifier's perspective, a
   malicious _digester_ in the split signing model would have the same
   powers as a malicious signature generator in a single-party signing
   model.  Thus, on the application or protocol level, assuming an
   honest _digester_ is no more restrictive than assuming an honest
   signature generator.

4.2.  Component-Level Trusted Roles

   The reasoning in Section 4.1 does not hold on the component level.  A
   _signer_ implementation MUST NOT assume that the _digester_
   implementation it interoperates with is necessarily honest.  Split
   signing algorithms MUST NOT be defined in a way that enables a
   malicious _digester_ with access to an honest _signer_ to produce
   forgeries - any that could not be produced by simply requesting a
   signature over the desired message - or extract secrets from the
   _signer_.

   For example, for ECDSA (Section 2.1), a malicious _digester_ can
   choose _H_ in such a way that the _signer_ will derive any
   _digester_-chosen value of _e_, including zero or other potentially
   problematic values.  Fortunately, in this case, this does not enable
   the _digester_ to extract the signature nonce or private key.  It
   also does not make forgeries easier, since the _digester_ still needs
   to find a preimage of _e_ for the relevant hash function.
   Definitions of other algorithms need to ensure that similar chosen-
   input attacks do not enable extracting secrets or forging protocol-
   level messages.

   For example, a naively prehashed version of FALCON [FALCON] would
   allow such a key compromise: A FALCON signature is a value s such
   that both s and s * h - hash(r || m) are short, where h is the public
   key and r a randomizer.  If the digester gets to query the signer for
   signatures of arbitrary stand-ins for hash(r || m), they can extract
   the private key by for example asking for repeated signatures of 0.
   Therefore, definitions of split signing algorithms need to be
   reviewed and potentially have security proofs adjusted.

4.3.  Incorrect Use of Split Signing Algorithm Identifiers

   Section 2 recommends against exposing split signing algorithm
   identifiers - including those defined in this specification with
   "-split" in their names - to signature verifiers.  For example, they
   should not appear as the "alg" parameter of a COSE_Key public key
   sent to a signature verifier.  If a split signing algorithm
   identifier is encountered in an invalid context like this, the
   recipient SHOULD reject the message with a fatal error.

   This is because the purpose of these split signing algorithm
   identifiers is to enable more flexible production of signatures that
   can be verified by existing implementations of existing verification
   algorithms.  A prevalence of these identifiers appearing outside the
   split signing context would defeat this purpose; we therefore
   recommend such use SHOULD NOT be tolerated.

   This recommendation is the opposite of the oft-cited "robustness
   principle" stated in paragraph 3.9 of [RFC1958].  Implementations MAY
   choose to instead follow the robustness principle and tolerate
   incorrect use of split signing algorithm identifiers, instead
   interpreting the identifier as referencing the defined corresponding
   verification algorithm.  Note however that this is no longer
   considered a best practice and is likely to harm interoperability
   [RFC9413].

   A verifier's choice to tolerate or not tolerate incorrect use of
   split signing algorithm identifiers is expected to not affect
   security, assuming a split algorithm identifier is interpreted as an
   alias representing the same verification algorithm as a non-split
   algorithm identifier.

5.  Implementation Considerations

5.1.  Using Non-Split Signing Algorithm Identifiers in a Split Signing
      Protocol

   A protocol designed to use split signing algorithm identifiers such
   as those defined in this specification MAY also allow use of
   algorithm identifiers that do not represent split signing algorithms.
   In this case, the _signer_ performs all steps of the signing
   procedure as usual.  For example, if the _signer_ receives a
   signature request with an the algorithm identifier "ESP256", then the
   _digester_ passes the input data through unmodified and it is the
   _signer_ that computes the SHA-256 digest of the input data as
   defined in the ESP256 definition [RFC9864].

7.  Implementation Status

   This section is to be removed from the specification by the RFC
   Editor before publication as an RFC.

   There are currently two known implementations using features defined
   by this specification:

   *  wwWallet (https://github.com/wwWallet), an EU Digital Identity
      pilot project. wwWallet was entered into the "EUDI Wallet
      Prototypes" competition held by SprinD GmbH
      (https://www.sprind.org/en/actions/challenges/eudi-wallet-
      prototypes), and a branch of the wallet was submitted in the
      competition.  The competition entry implements ARKG
      [I-D.bradleylundberg-ARKG] for efficiently generating single-use
      hardware-bound holder binding keys.

      The implementation (https://github.com/gunet/funke-s3a-wallet-
      frontend/blob/stage-3/src/services/keystore.ts) uses the
      COSE_Key_Ref data structure defined in version 01 of this
      specification in order to send ARKG inputs to a WebAuthn
      authenticator, and uses the placeholder value for the experimental
      split algorithm identifier ESP256-split-ARKG defined in
      Section 5.2 of [I-D.bradleylundberg-ARKG] to negotiate creation
      and usage of ARKG-derived keys for signing operations.  Thus
      wwWallet assumes the _digester_ role while the WebAuthn
      authenticator assumes the _signer_ role.

   *  Yubico (https://www.yubico.com/), a hardware security key vendor,
      has produced limited-availability prototypes of their YubiKey
      product with an ARKG implementation interoperable with wwWallet.
      The YubiKey implementation uses the COSE_Key_Ref data structure
      defined in version 01 of this specification to receive ARKG inputs
      from a WebAuthn Relying Party, and uses the placeholder value for
      the experimental split algorithm identifier ESP256-split-ARKG
      defined in Section 5.2 of [I-D.bradleylundberg-ARKG] to negotiate
      creation and usage of ARKG-derived keys for signing operations.
      Thus the YubiKey assumes the _signer_ role while the WebAuthn
      Relying Party assumes the _digester_ role.

   Table 4 summarizes implementation status for individual features.

7.1.  Dependent Specifications

   As indicated in the previous section, the Internet-Draft of ARKG
   [I-D.bradleylundberg-ARKG] extends this specification with
   definitions for ARKG:

   *  Section "5.2 COSE algorithms" defines COSE algorithm identifiers
      ESP256-split-ARKG, ESP384-split-ARKG and ESP512-split-ARKG based
      on the ECDSA identifiers defined in this specification
      (Section 2.1).

   *  Section "5.3 COSE signing arguments" defines a representation for
      ARKG arguments using the COSE_Sign_Args data structure defined in
      this specification (Section 3).
